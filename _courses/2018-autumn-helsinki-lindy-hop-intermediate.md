### Content
In this course you will get to know certain lindy hop styles, larger concepts, strengthen your basics but also be challenged with more advanced moves and variations. We expect students to attend Intermediate level classes for at least one year before advancing to Intermediate-Advanced.

We rotate partners during lesson.

### Requirements
This level is for dancers, who are comfortable social dancing Lindy Hop on a regular basis. You are familiar with grooves, kicks and triples and you handle a stable set of patterns in closed and open position. You already might have some notion on interpreting music, tricky patterns and simple footwork variations. You might already have attended some Lindy hop events abroad.

__Previous course level:__ Improvers+
