### Content
In this course you will improve your skills to lead and follow collegiate shag, learn a larger variety of moves and stylings and get the tools to express your musicality during socials.

In the beginning we review the basics of shag:, posture, energy conservation, basic steps and hold steps and partner connection. During the course you will learn variations as double kicks, cross-steps kick-step etc. You will get new styling options like heel-toes and slides and new moves like rocksteps and fishes. Musicality-wise you will acquire tools to break free from the six-count basic shag. 

We rotate partners during lesson.
