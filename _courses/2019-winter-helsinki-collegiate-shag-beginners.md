### Content

This course consists of two parts:
 
Part I (25.1.-15.2.) is suitable for total Beginners and anyone who wants to polish their basics. You will learn how to move yourself and with your partner to that uptempo Shag music. We will work on basic patterns, rhythms, footwork drills, and fundamentals of partner connection. In this part everyone learns to lead and follow the Shag basics.
 
Part II (22.2.-15.3.) is suitable for those who already have solid Shag basics. The course material will offer new challenges also for those who have previously attended Improvers level classes and/or intense weekend workshops. During this part of the course you can specialize in one role. 
 
As registration option you can either take Part I + Part II or only Part II.

Collegiate Shag is one of various historical shag dance forms which became popular in America during the 1920-1930s. The fast footwork and energetic style as well as a hilarious easy-going attitude are the probably most remarkable characteristics of the dance. Shag was originally danced to Ragtime but was adapted other styles like swing and R&B music. The tempo scale ranges from mid-tempo to upper tempos.
