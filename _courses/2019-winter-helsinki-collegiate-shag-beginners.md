### Content
This course aims at teaching you the very basics of Collegiate Shag. You will learn how to move yourself and with your partner to faster tempo swing tunes. We will work on basic patterns, rhythms, footwork drills, and fundamentals of partner connection.

If you have been dancing shag before, this course could still be for you! After 4 weeks we move more towards improvers stuff, so we are sure you get enough challenges. If you have never danced before, no worries, we start from very basics so it's easy for everyone to join in :).
