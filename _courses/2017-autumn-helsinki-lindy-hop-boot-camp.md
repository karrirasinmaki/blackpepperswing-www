This course does not have a level in particular but the access to the course is decided by motivation. The course is aimed at those who are ready to  go through training routines outside class and take a focus on the most basic concepts of partnered and solo dancing. You will also learn how to practise better on your own. Some topics of the course will be quality and aesthetics of movement, body posture, partner communication, performing and many more.

The course is led by Laura Halttunen, but other top teachers are invited frequently.

Registration alone or in couple. In the registration form you will have to answer a couple of questions. Chosen dancers will receive a confirmation latest one week before the start of the course.
