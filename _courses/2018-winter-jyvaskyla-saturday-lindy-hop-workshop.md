Saturday Lindy hop workshop in Jyväskylä with Jaana and Marko Moisio!

You have already done some Lindy hop, or taken a Beginners course with University Sports of Jyväskylä?
If you know have to dance triple steps, groove walks then this is the tailored intensive course for you.

During this teaching session you will:

- polish the triple step basics with basic patterns
- learn fancy new moves.

We rotate partners during the lesson but you will specialise mainly in one role (leading or following).
You can sign up alone or with a partner. Single registrations are accepted in order of registration.
