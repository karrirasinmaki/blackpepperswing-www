teaser: Jyväskylä Saturday lindy hop workshop is here again! This time we focus on working with charleston, kick-steps and slightly faster tempos
---

You have already dance some Lindy hop and you know basic rhythms and how to lead/follow basic patterns (improver/intermediate dancers). 

In this intensive course you will:
- polish your charleston/kick-step basics 
- learn new charleston patterns 
- get more comfortable dancing faster music
- develop your following / leading technique 

We rotate partners during the lesson but you will specialise mainly in one role (leading or following). You can sign up alone or with a partner. Single registrations are accepted in order of registration. If you sign up without the partner, you may end up on a waiting list. 

3-hour course (including breaks). Teaching in English.
