### Content
The course description will be updated soon. This course would be the suggested group for the previous [Intermediate course, group 1]({{ site.url }}/courses/2018-winter-helsinki-lindy-hop-intermediate-1).

We rotate partners during lesson.

### Requirements
This level is for dancers, who are comfortable social dancing Lindy Hop on a regular basis. You are familiar with grooves, kicks and triples and you handle a stable set of patterns in closed and open position. You already might have some notion on interpreting music, tricky patterns and simple footwork variations. You might already have attended some Lindy hop events abroad.

We expect you to be taken Intermediate classes worth of 1-2 courses or seasons (2-6 months).
