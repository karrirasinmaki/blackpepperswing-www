### Content
In this course you will explore tap dancing as a part of swing dance family. We’ll go through basic steps, practise rhythms and timing, and also learn catchy combinations to practice while waiting for your bus in cold winter days. You might even learn bits and pieces of tap shim sham, which by the way was the original one before lindy version!

### Requirements
You have some experience in swing dancing.

You don’t need to buy tap shoes for the course, but if you happen to have them or can borrow somewhere, you’ll of course get a better experience of what tap dancing is. Hard sole shoes will anyway work just fine for this intro course.
