_(A small compilation of recaps of the last Bal 'n Shag course)_


4h of Balboa with Sanna & Adam  
4h of Collegiate Shag with Ulla & Klasu

During the Beginners+ level you will learn more dance vocabulary, get more details on footwork and technique to become more fluent and smooth in both dances.

This course is suitable if you can already lead and follow a few simple figures. Alternatively, you should have significant experience in other dances and be ready to work more to catch up with the group if you have not taken Balboa/ Shag classes before.
