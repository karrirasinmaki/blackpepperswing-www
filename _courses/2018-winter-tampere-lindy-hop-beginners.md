This course aims at learning the basics of Lindy hop. You will learn how to move yourself and a partner to swinging jazz tunes. We will work on typical patterns, rhythms and fundamentals of partner connection. The main goal of the course is to get you a feeling for the Lindy hop, leading and following and to prepare you for social dancing. We rotate partners and change roles during the lesson. You may sign up alone or with a partner.

### What is special about this course?

As in most of our Lindy hop Beginners courses, you will learn both roles of the dance – how to be the leader and the follower! Later you can pick either role to specialize in, but having basic knowledge of both will make you a better dancer. Old dance for people with modern values :)

### What is the Lindy Hop?

Lindy hop, also called Jitterbug, is known as the ”original” afro-american swing dance, which evolved during the American Jazz era in Harlem, New York. This rhythmic and joyful couple dance can be danced to fast and slow jazz music as it was played e.g. by Duke Ellington, Count Basie or Benny Goodman. Lindy hop experienced a huge revival in the 1990’s and has since then spread all over the planet. Are you ready to be part of the revival and swing out with us?
