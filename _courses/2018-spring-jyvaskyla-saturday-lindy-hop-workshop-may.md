Whether you have taken latest Saturday lindy hop workshops or danced even a bit longer already, this course will be suitable for you. We'll spice up your dancing with different variations and give you styling options to play with. You should be able to throw a couple of swing outs in a row since that is going to be one of our main playgrounds during the workshop.

In this intensive course you will:
- learn new ways to variate your footwork
- get a grasp of different styling options
- improve your solo movement in partner dancing
- get an idea how connection affects/provokes different variations

We rotate partners during the lesson but you will specialize mainly in one role (leading or following). You can sign up alone or with a partner. Single registrations are accepted in order of registration. If you sign up without the partner, you may end up on a waiting list. 

3-hour course + breaks (one longer break in between).
