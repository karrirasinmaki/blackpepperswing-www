You have been dancing for one year or longer. You should be familiar with grooves, kicks, triples and you handle a stable set of patterns in closed and open position. You already might have some notion on interpreting music, tricky patterns and simple footwork variations.

In this course you will get to know certain lindy hop styles, larger concepts, strengthen your basics but also be challenged with more advanced moves and variations.
