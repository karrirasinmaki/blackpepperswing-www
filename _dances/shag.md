Collegiate Shag is one of various historical shag dance forms which became popular in America during the 1920-1930s. The fast footwork and energetic style as well as a hilarious easy-going attitude are the probably most remarkable characteristics of the dance. Shag was originally danced to Ragtime but was adapted other styles like swing and R&B music. The tempo scale ranges from mid-tempo to upper tempos. Shag can also provide Lindy hoppers with some new ingredients for their dancing.
