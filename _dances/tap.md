Tap dancing was more or less a must for any dancer during the era of American show business of the golden age of pre-jazz and jazz. A percussive dance based on rhythm, timing and balance, where the executor is also a front line musician. Tap dancing became famous through tons of Hollywood movies with dancers Betty Grable, Ruby Keeler, Eleanor Powell, Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly and Bill Robinson and it is still often brought back to the silver screen in modern movies like La La Land.
