This dance was born in California in the second half of the 1920â€™s. The music of choice for Balboa is uptempo swingmusic. Balboa was danced in crowded ballrooms, which led to most of the dance to happen in closed position focusing on sophisticated partner connection and fancy footwork. That form of the dance is nowadays often referred to as Pure Balboa. With time dancers started opening the tight closed position and integrating flashier moves, which is today often called Balswing. Balboa gives the dancers challenging footwork and connection rewarded with a floating feeling.
