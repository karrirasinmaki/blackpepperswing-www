<p>We focus on teaching and practising authentic swing dances. These dance forms from America’s 1920’s to 1940’s are all marked by their development as social dances. They also formed the roots for many well known modern street dances. Thanks to the large swing dance revival of the 1990’s they are now more popular than ever before and inspire people all over the planet to dance with each other.</p>

<p>Spreading swing dancing in modern society means inspiring people to connect with jazz music, themselves and each other. We offer engaging, precise and fun teaching from the first course on. And we make sure your dance time is not limited to the lessons.</p>

<p>Lindy hop, Shag and Balboa, Solo Jazz and Tap Dancing - for dancers of different levels and with different aims. Get started or get better. Check which course would suit you.</p>

<p><b>COVID-19</b> | March 29, 2020</p>
<h3>Classes on hold</h3>
<p><i>We are hopefully back in summer.</i></p>
<p>More restrictions have been imposed and we are unfortunately not very hopeful to restart our teaching activity before the end of May. We are really terribly sorry for this unhoped-for dance break.</p>
<p>We will offer summer classes - classes on weekdays and workshops on weekends. This means we will teach in June and August, maybe also in July. All this will depend on the further development of the situation and we will, of course, keep you updated.</p>
<p>More info about cancelled courses and reimbursements will be sent to all participants.</p>
<p>We miss teaching and seeing you! Stay healthy and happy!</p>

<p>Lindy hop, also called Jitterbug, is known as the ”original” afro-american swing dance, which evolved during the American Jazz era in Harlem, New York. This rhytmic and joyful couple dance can be danced to fast and slow jazz music as it was played e.g. by Duke Ellington, Count Basie or Benny Goodman. Lindy hop experienced a huge revival in the 1990’s and has since then spread all over the planet.  Are you ready to be part of the revival and swing out with us?</p>

<p>This dance was born in California in the second half of the 1920’s. The music of choice for Balboa is uptempo swingmusic. Balboa was danced in crowded ballrooms, which led to most of the dance to happen in closed position focusing on sophisticated partner connection and fancy footwork. That form of the dance is nowadays often referred to as Pure Balboa. With time dancers started opening the tight closed position and integrating flashier moves, which is today often called Balswing. Balboa gives the dancers challenging footwork and connection rewarded with a floating feeling.</p>

<p>Collegiate Shag is one of various historical shag dance forms which became popular in America during the 1920-1930s. The fast footwork and energetic style as well as a hilarious easy-going attitude are the probably most remarkable characteristics of the dance. Shag was originally danced to Ragtime but was adapted other styles like swing and R&amp;B music. The tempo scale ranges from mid-tempo to upper tempos. Shag can also provide Lindy hoppers with some new ingredients for their dancing.</p>

<p>Solo Jazz is a collective term that can refer to anything from the pre-Cake Walk dances to post war era material linked with be-bop as well as rhythm ‘n’ blues music. Other than the names suggests Solo jazz can be danced alone, with a partner or in a group. It often comes along choreographed as in routines and performances or improvised as in jam circles or battle formats.</p>

<p>Tap dancing was more or less a must for any dancer during the era of American show business of the golden age of pre-jazz and jazz. A percussive dance based on rhythm, timing and balance, where the executor is also a front line musician. Tap dancing became famous through tons of Hollywood movies with dancers Betty Grable, Ruby Keeler, Eleanor Powell, Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly and Bill Robinson and it is still often brought back to the silver screen in modern movies like La La Land.</p>
