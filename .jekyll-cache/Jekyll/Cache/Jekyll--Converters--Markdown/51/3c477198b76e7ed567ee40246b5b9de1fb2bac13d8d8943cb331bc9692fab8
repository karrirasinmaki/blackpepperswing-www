    <h2 id="private-classes">Private classes</h2>
    <p><em>For intensive training and more personal instruction.</em></p>

    <p>No time for weekly classes or you feel you need more personal instruction? You can take private classes with one or two instructors at a time. Private classes can have many purposes: you might want to catch up on class material, finetune your dancing and correct habits, learn special skills or movements of your choice etc. In a private class you get plenty of feedback and homework.</p>

    <p>Private classes can be demanding, which is why we can do them for 30min, 45min, or 60min. You can either choose to do the classes with only one or two teachers.</p>
