<p>Are you a Lindy hop Newbie? This track is for everyone who has maybe never danced before or is not yet comfortable with the basics. You don’t need any previous experience nor a partner. The very experienced teacher Adrian Ehrlich will take you through the fundamentals of the dance in four hours of classes.</p>

<p>Helswingi’s Sunday party is included in the price of the Beginners’ track, so you get to apply everything you learned during the weekend on the social dance floor - and meet the community.</p>

<p>Saturday: 12.00 - 14.00<br />
Sunday: 13.00 - 15.00</p>

<p><em>Workshop includes also Helswingi Sunday party and Sunday taster.</em></p>
