<p>What is Lindy Hop?</p>

<p>Lindy hop, also called Jitterbug, is known as the ”original” afro-american swing dance, which evolved during the American Jazz era in Harlem, New York. This rhytmic and joyful couple dance can be danced to fast and slow jazz music as it was played e.g. by Duke Ellington, Count Basie or Benny Goodman. Lindy hop experienced a huge revival in the 1990’s and has since then spread all over the planet. Are you ready to be part of the revival and swing out with us?</p>
