<p>This course aims at teaching you the very basics of Lindy hop. You will learn how to move yourself and with your partner to swinging jazz tunes. We will work on basic patterns, rhythms and fundamentals of partner connection.</p>

<p>We rotate partners during lesson.</p>

<p>Note: In all our Beginners courses all participants learn to lead and follow. We have seen, that this leads to the best learning results. (ELEF = everybody leads, everybody follows). In following courses, you can either choose to continue with both roles or specialize in one.</p>
