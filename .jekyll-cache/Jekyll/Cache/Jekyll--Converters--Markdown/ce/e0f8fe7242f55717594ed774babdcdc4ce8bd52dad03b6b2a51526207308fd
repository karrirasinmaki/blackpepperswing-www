<p>Lindy hop is often referred to as swing dancing. That‚Äôs pretty logical because we Lindy hoppers lindy hop on swing music. Swing music was the prevailing popular music style in 1920-40‚Äôs America. Young folks of those days would go out and swing out all night long in crowded ballrooms. They called their dance ‚Äúthe Lindy‚Äù. And ‚Äúthe Lindy‚Äù was already a game changer back then: It brought black and white Americans alike to the same dance floors. Up to this day Lindy hop keeps changing people‚Äôs lives.</p>

<h2 id="1-it-is-the-second-best-way-to-meet-people-beside-sauna">1. It is the second best way to meet people (beside sauna)</h2>

<p>Lindy hop is a social dance. The basic idea of this dance is to meet people, dance with them, meet more people, dance more, and so on. And many times, you can even find friends for a lifetime.</p>

<p>We all have had those empty evenings when we just scroll the whole night through cat clips and wonder what went wrong in our life.

<h2 id="3-it-makes-travelling-the-world-easier">3. It makes travelling the world easier</h2>

<p>Lindy hoppers are a closely-knit community. Once you start getting the hang of the bouncing, tripling and kicking you will realize, that Lindy hop events and classes take place literally all over the globe. Suddenly you will have a very easy time meeting locals wherever, once you find their Lindy venue. And in fact, you will no longer need to rely on knowing a language to communicate. Just ask them for a dance!</p>

<h2 id="4-it-keeps-up-with-modern-values">4. It keeps up with modern values</h2>

<p>Lindy hop developed in an era when gender and race inequalities were immense social problems. The dance broke down many of these barriers and continues to do so. In the dance scene, you will meet people from many different backgrounds and layers of life. The leader and follower role can change during a dance and it is not defined by gender.</p>

<h2 id="5-it-is-pretty-good-physical-exercise">5. It is pretty good physical exercise</h2>

<p>There is a reason, why many lindy hoppers bring a couple of extra shirts to their classes and parties. Lindy hop can be physically very demanding and it is 100% normal to sweat during this dance. It includes diverse forms of exercise: you can go all the way from jumping, kicking and running motion to slow and grounded movement.  Even when dancing slowly, your core muscles will be at work at all time, so don‚Äôt be surprised by aching muscles the next day.</p>

<h2 id="6-it-is-screen-free">6. It is screen-free</h2>

<p>We live in a digitalized world. Work, school and a big part of our social life happen across screens. We guarantee you: Lindy hop classes and social dances are one of the few remaining screen-free oases in dear, technologically advanced Finland. Instead of reading this article you should actually already be out there learning your first swing outs.</p>
