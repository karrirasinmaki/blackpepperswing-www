<p><em>(A small compilation of recaps of the last Bal ‚Äòn Shag course)</em></p>

<p>4h of Balboa with Sanna &amp; Adam<br />
4h of Collegiate Shag with Ulla &amp; Klasu</p>

<p>During the Beginners+ level you will learn more dance vocabulary, get more details on footwork and technique to become more fluent and smooth in both dances.</p>

<p>This course is suitable if you can already lead and follow a few simple figures. Alternatively, you should have significant experience in other dances and be ready to work more to catch up with the group if you have not taken Balboa/ Shag classes before.</p>

<p>Registration open for the shag part of the course!</p>
