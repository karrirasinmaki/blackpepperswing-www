<p>Come and join our Beginnersâ€™ weekend course to get your Lindy hop started, or maybe to strengthen your base!</p>

<p>During the total of ~ 4h of lessons you will get a profound insight into the world of authentic swing dancing. You will get a sense of interpreting swinging rhythm in dancing, how to both* lead and follow movement, and learn some of the moves lindy hoppers have been rocking since the 1920â€™s.</p>

<p>No previous experience whatsoever needed!</p>

<p><em>*Note: In all our Beginners courses all participants learn to lead and follow. We have seen, that this leads to the best learning results. (ELEF = everybody leads, everybody follows). You can read more about the benefits of double role learning here: <a href="https://bravenewswing.de/elef/">https://bravenewswing.de/elef/</a></em></p>
