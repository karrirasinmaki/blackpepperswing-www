<h3 id="about-the-musicians">About the musicians</h3>

<p><strong>Antti Sarpila</strong> is an internationally known jazz musicians from Finland. He has been a student of the world famous American clarinet and saxophone player Bob Wilber during the 1980â€™s. Wilber himself was a student of legendary Sidney Bechet in the 1940â€™s. This legacy is the reason for Anttiâ€™s dedication and respect to the traditions in jazz. He wants to combine the influences captured from the early masters, from Louis Armstrong to Charlie Parker, with his own personal style to create, what would today be described as classic jazz.</p>
