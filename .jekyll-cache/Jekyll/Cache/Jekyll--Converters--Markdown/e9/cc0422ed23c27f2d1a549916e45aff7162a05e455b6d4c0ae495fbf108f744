<p><b>COVID-19</b> | March 29, 2020</p>
<h3>Classes on hold</h3>
<p><i>We are hopefully back in summer.</i></p>
<p>More restrictions have been imposed and we are unfortunately not very hopeful to restart our teaching activity before the end of May. We are really terribly sorry for this unhoped-for dance break.</p>
<p>We will offer summer classes - classes on weekdays and workshops on weekends. This means we will teach in June and August, maybe also in July. All this will depend on the further development of the situation and we will, of course, keep you updated.</p>
<p>More info about cancelled courses and reimbursements will be sent to all participants.</p>
<p>We miss teaching and seeing you! Stay healthy and happy!</p>
