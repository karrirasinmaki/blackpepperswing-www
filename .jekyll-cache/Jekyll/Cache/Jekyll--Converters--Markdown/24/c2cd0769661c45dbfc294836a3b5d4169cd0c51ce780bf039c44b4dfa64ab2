<p>Solo Jazz is a collective term that can refer to anything from the pre-Cake Walk dances to post war era material linked with be-bop as well as rhythm â€˜nâ€™ blues music. Other than the names suggests Solo jazz can be danced alone, with a partner or in a group. It often comes along choreographed as in routines and performances or improvised as in jam circles or battle formats.</p>
