<h2 id="about-this-course">About this course</h2>

<p>Weâ€™ll go through basic steps, practice rhythms and timing, and also learn catchy combinations to drill while waiting for your bus. Who knows, you might even learn bits and pieces of tap shim sham, which by the way was the original one before the Lindy version!</p>

<p>The workshop covers 4 hours of tapping, Saturday and Sunday from 12 PM - 2 PM. This is a good chance to get the basic skills of tap dance (or freshen up your taps from previous courses!) to continue with the weekly classes every Wednesday 18.00-19.00 in Kirjantalo.</p>
