# What is Lindy hop...

Lindy hop is often referred to as swing dancing. That’s pretty logical, because we Lindy hoppers lindy hop on swing music. Swing music was the prevailing popular music style in 1920-40’s America. Young folks of those days would go out and dance their feet sore in crowded ballrooms while swinging out all night long. They called this dance “the Lindy”. And “the Lindy” was already a game changer back then: It brought black and white Americans alike to the same dance floors.

# ...and why you should do it, too

## 1. It is real

We live in digitalized world. Work, school and a big part of our social life happen across screens. We guarantee you: Lindy hop classes and social dances are one of the few remaining screen-free oases in highly technologicalized Finland. Instead of reading this article you should actually already be out there learning your first swing outs.

## 2. It is the second best way to meet people (beside sauna)

Lindy hop is a social dance. The basic idea of this dance is to meet people, dance with them, meet more people, dance more, repeat. And many times, you can even find friends for a lifetime.

## 3. It keeps up with modern values

Lindy hop developed in an era when gender and race inequalities were immense social problems. The dance broke down many of these barriers and continues to do so. In the dance scene you will meet people from many different backgrounds and layers of life. The leader and follower role can change during a dance and it is not defined by gender.

## 4. It makes travelling the world easier

Lindy hoppers are a closely-knit community.

## 5. It fills your empty evenings

We all have those empty evenings when we just wonder what went wrong in our life that we find ourselves exploring the darkest corners of the Internet. Well, actually, Lindy hop might help you to have less of those evenings. Just fill in with a couple of Lindy classes and socials per week and you might soon find your calendar flooded with all kind of dance or dance-people-related activities. 



## 6. It’s good physical exercise

There is a reason, why many lindy hoppers bring a couple of extra shirts to their dance classes or parties. Lindy hop can be physically demanding and it is 100% normal to sweat during this dance. It is also very diverse as you can go all the way from jumping, kicking and running motion to slow and grounded dancing.  Even when danced slowly, your core muscles will be at work at all time, so don’t be surprised by aching muscles the next day.
