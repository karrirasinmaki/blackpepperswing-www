## Get dancing with a 10-class-card!

Few things in Swing dancing come as ten counts, our serial cards are one of those rarities!

With a 10 class punch card you can attend our [weekly classes](/courses){:target="_blank"} flexibly according to your own schedule on a drop-in basis.

We definitely recommend taking complete courses when you can commit, but, however, we understand that for some people spontaneous dance evenings are more suitable, and that in the current climate it can be difficult to commit - hence the newcomer's ten-class card!

The card is valid until the end of the season and you can use it for all our weekly classes until that date. You can also share the card with family members or friends, for example.
