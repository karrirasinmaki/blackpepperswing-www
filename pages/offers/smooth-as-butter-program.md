## More info

### Lindy Hop / Solo Jazz & Charleston

This program includes two styles of authentic swing dancing: Lindy Hop which is couple dancing, and Solo Jazz & Charleston which is solo dancing. These dance styles experienced a huge revival in the 1990’s and have since then spread all over the planet.

</div>

**Lindy Hop** is an energetic and rhythmical couple dance that emerged in the African-American communities in Harlem, New York, during the late 1920’s. It became a dance craze with the popularisation of jazz music by artists like Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Benny Goodman and countless others. In Lindy hop both partners are invited to improvise within the flow of the dance and to have an equal voice.

</div>

**Solo Jazz & Charleston** has its roots in authentic swing and jazz dance styles dating back to the 1920s to 1940s. The dance gets its inspiration from African-American roots and various styles of jazz music - big band swing, rhythm ‘n’ blues, and be-bop, to name a few. Like Lindy Hop, it’s full of freedom, personal expression, and improvisation. It often comes along choreographed as in routines and performances or improvised as in jam circles and battle formats.

### Jazz music from the great swing era

We like to dance to the grooving, swinging, and rocking jazz/swing/blues music from and inspired of the great swing era roughly between 1920-1960.

Here you can take a peek to bunch of our favourite songs from both original and modern-time artists.
