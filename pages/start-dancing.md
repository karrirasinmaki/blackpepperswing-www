### Well hello there!

So you have heard about swing dancing? Or appareantly thinking about starting a dance hobby? You are in a right place!

**At the end of this article, we list suitable beginners' courses for you.**

We are your local swing dance school here in Helsinki. We offer variety of dance classes from Lindy Hop to Tap Dancing. Some of the classes are solo classes, some are partnered.

Partnered classes are in Lindy Hop and Boogie Woogie, where we dance with a dance partner. You can however join without a partner! You'll find a partner from the course. In fact, we like to rotate partners so you get to dance with many people.

Solo classes can be found from Solo Jazz & Charleston courses, Tap Dancing, and Electro Swing. Even though we dance there in a group, we do the movements on our own. Kinda like most of us would imagine dancing at a club.

Here are samples of Solo Jazz (first video), and Lindy Hop (second video).

## Which courses should I pick?

You can start with any beginners' course, really. But...

...if you want to learn how to partner dance, take [Lindy Hop](https://portal.blackpepperswing.com/courses?q=lindy%20hop%20beginners).

...if you prefer flying solo or want to enrichen your body language take [Solo Jazz](https://portal.blackpepperswing.com/courses?q=solo%20jazz).

...if you like rhythms or love Gene Kelly, [Tap Dancing](https://portal.blackpepperswing.com/courses?q=tap%20beginners) would be your thing.

And of course, if you can't decide, you can take two courses for example.
