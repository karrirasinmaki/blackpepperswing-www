<h2>Hello!</h2>

Welcome to start your swing dance journey!

On this page is listed all the necessary practical information for the course start.

More info can be found on the <a href="https://portal.blackpepperswing.com/courses" target="_blank">course pages</a> and our <a href="https://portal.blackpepperswing.com/help" target="_blank">support portal</a>.

All of our classes are held at our dance studios at Karjalankatu 2. 

<h3>Clothing and gear</h3>
For the clothing, any clothes are ok, as long as you are comfortable and they allow some movement.

Footwear for most people are indoor shoes (sneakers etc.), but also socks or barefoot is ok. Your teachers will happily give more recommendations about the footwear.

You can be mentally prepared to sweat, so bringing a water bottle and a spare shirt may be a good idea.


<h3>Location</h3>
The location is Alppitalo at Karjalankatu 2. There are Black Pepper Swing signs at the main entrance.

If you get lost or can't get it, call +358 84 154 1724.

<h3>Parking</h3>
You can find several spots for your bicycles around the building.

Also, for cars, there are 3 free parking spots in the yard (2h with a parking disc, marked with the parking sign). The rest are reserved for tenants.

More parking spots can be found by the street (regular street parking, zone 2), which is 2â‚¬/h and free on Saturday and Sunday.


<h3>Dance studios</h3>
Our studios are on the 4th floor. Follow the signs to find us.

We have classes in two dance rooms and you'll be guided to the correct one upon arrival.

Toilets and showers are located in the corridor of the 4th and 3rd floors, and we have one unisex toilet inside the studios.

We also have a kitchen where you can hang out before/after and between classes. If you store something in the fridge, please mark your foods. Sometimes you may find beverages and snacks with affordable prices available.

Next to the kitchen, there is a separate room where you can change your clothes.

You can also <a href="https://blackpepperswing.com/studio-rental/" target="_blank">rent the studio</a> for your own practice sessions.
