# What we dance

We focus on teaching and practising authentic jazz dances. These dance forms from America’s 1920’s to 1940’s are all marked by their development as social dances. They also formed the roots for many well known modern street dances. Thanks to the large swing dance revival of the 1990’s they are now more popular than ever before and inspire people all over the planet to dance with each other.

    <h2>Lindy Hop</h2>
    <p>Lindy hop, also called Jitterbug, is known as the ”original” afro-american swing dance, which evolved during the American Jazz era in Harlem, New York. This rhytmic and joyful couple dance can be danced to fast and slow jazz music as it was played e.g. by Duke Ellington, Count Basie or Benny Goodman. Lindy hop experienced a huge revival in the 1990’s and has since then spread all over the planet.  Are you ready to be part of the revival and swing out with us?</p>

    <h2>Balboa</h2>
    <p>This dance was born in California in the second half of the 1920’s. The music of choice for Balboa is uptempo swingmusic. Balboa was danced in crowded ballrooms, which led to most of the dance to happen in closed position focusing on sophisticated partner connection and fancy footwork. That form of the dance is nowadays often referred to as Pure Balboa. With time dancers started opening the tight closed position and integrating flashier moves, which is today often called Balswing. Balboa gives the dancers challenging footwork and connection rewarded with a floating feeling.</p>

    <h2>Shag</h2>
    <p>Collegiate Shag is one of various historical shag dance forms which became popular in America during the 1920-1930s. The fast footwork and energetic style as well as a hilarious easy-going attitude are the probably most remarkable characteristics of the dance. Shag was originally danced to Ragtime but was adapted other styles like swing and R&B music. The tempo scale ranges from mid-tempo to upper tempos. Shag can also provide Lindy hoppers with some new ingredients for their dancing.</p>
