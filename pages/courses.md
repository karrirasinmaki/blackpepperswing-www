<h2><a id="levels"></a>Course roadmap and levels</h2>

<p>This is a rough cut into our levels. Dance development is very individual, so please ask us, if you are not sure, which level to attend (<a href="mailto:info@blackpepperswing.com">info@blackpepperswing.com</a>). Consecutive levels can be attended simultaneously.</p>

<p><strong>Beginners</strong><br>
Here we start from Zero. We build our fundamentals of Lindy hop, body movement and partner dancing in general. We cover things like dancing side-by-side, moving with triples in closed and open, swinging out and circling around.</p>

<p><strong>Improvers</strong><br>
In the first part of this course, we learn kicks in all the possible ways. In the second part, we practise combining triples and kicks freely. We learn more about technical aspects like frame, rotational and linear movement.</p>

<p><strong>Improvers+</strong><br>
In this course, we enlarge our swing dance vocabulary with the essential variations you may encounter on the social dance floor. We also learn more about technical aspects of own body movement that can enhance the dance experience for both.</p>

<p><strong>Intermediate 1-2</strong><br>
In the lower intermediate level courses, we throw together all the different building blocks we have learned so far at all time of our dancing. We start integrating footwork variations while maintaining a steady rhythm. We learn about song structures and how to make the most of the holy triangle: us, our partner and the music.</p>

<p><strong>Intermediate 3-4</strong><br>
In these courses, we start doing more complex movements and rhythms. We also deepen our understanding of our chore technique.</p>

<p><strong>Intermediate-Advanced</strong><br>
We do not offer this level yet.</p>

<p><strong>Advanced</strong><br>
We do not offer this level yet</p>

<p><strong>Theme courses</strong><br>
Additionally, to our different levels, we have courses without or with a level requirement. E.g. Tap for Lindy hoppers, House for Lindy hoppers, Solo Jazz for Lindy hoppers, etc.</p>
