### Good to know
General info for the season

Course registration for the upcoming season is now open.  
Classes start on week 3 (15th of January, 2024).

Most of the courses contains 18 weeks of classes plus possible break weeks. Starting right from the beginning of the season is recommended, but it's also possible to join any of the groups during the season.

We recommend registering for full courses, which allows you to progressivily grow with the group. Even if you have a [Dance Pass](/dance-passes), we recommend you to register for at least one course and taking it regularly.

For most courses, it's also possible to join only half of the season. Check out details on registration form or [contact us](/contact).
