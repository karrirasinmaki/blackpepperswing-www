You can join our swinging courses with a **Dance pass**, **Course registration**, or **10-class punch cards**.

The course registration has always been the most popular choice among students. Now we have also added 10-class punch cards for extra flexibility, and monthly dance passes for unlimited dancing.

If you are just visiting the city, or want to try out our classes, you can also just drop-in for any single classes.

Course registration for the Winter-Spring season opens November 18th at 10:00 (EET).  
Classes start on week 3 (16th of January, 2023).

Most of the courses contains 16 weeks of classes plus possible break weeks. Starting right from the beginning of the season is recommended, but it's also possible to join any of the groups during the season.

We recommend registering for full courses, which allows you to progressivily grow with the group. Even if you have a [Dance Pass](/dance-passes), we recommend you to register for at least one course and taking it regularly.

For 16-week courses, it's also possible to register for half of the course (8 weeks).

Also, you can join single classes with a [10-class punch card](/punch-cards) or [Dance Pass](/dance-passes).

All our classes are in English unless otherwise mentioned.
