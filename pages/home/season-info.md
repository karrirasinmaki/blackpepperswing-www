You can join our swinging courses with a **Dance pass**, **Course registration**, or **10-class punch cards**.

The course registration has always been the most popular choice among students. Recently Dance Pass has become a popular option for dance enthusiasts, and 10-class punch cards for those who need some extra flexibility.

If you are just visiting the city, or want to try out our classes, you can also just drop-in for any single classes.
