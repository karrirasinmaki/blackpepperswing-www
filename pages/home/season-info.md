You can join our swinging courses with a **Dance pass**, **Course registration**, or **10-class punch cards**.

The course registration has always been the most popular choice among students. Now we have also added 10-class punch cards for extra flexibility, and monthly dance passes for unlimited dancing.

If you are just visiting the city, or want to try out our classes, you can also just drop-in for any single classes.
