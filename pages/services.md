## Private classes
*For intensive training and more personal instruction.*

No time for weekly classes or you feel you need more personal instruction? You can take private classes with one or two instructors at a time. Private classes can have many purposes: you might want to catch up on class material, finetune your dancing and correct habits, learn special skills or movements of your choice etc. In a private class you get plenty of feedback and homework.

Private classes can be demanding, which is why we can do them for 30min, 45min, or 60min. You can either choose to do the classes with only one or two teachers.

All private classes include the studio rental!

## Courses and weekly classes
*For a comprehensive learning experience.*

Courses and weekly classes are our default learning environment. By attending weekly classes you keep your progress steady and get a little bit better all the time. You get support from peers and teachers and can influence course content. We encourage all students to get more dance time e.g. by attending social dance events or weekend workshops.
