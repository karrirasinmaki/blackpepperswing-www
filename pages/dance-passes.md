**Get the total freedom of dancing with the newly launched dance passes!**

With the [Dance Pass][1] you can attend all our [weekly classes](/courses) and activities. All the classes are included, so take as many courses and classes as you like!

One pass, all the classes.

We simply love dancing and you probably too. Dance Pass allows us to offer you unlimited classes and activities so you can spend more time on what you love - dancing!


### Dance passes

This is simply the best package we offer! With single payment you get to take all our classes and literally live and breathe the dance.

Also, the more you commit to dance, the more we want to commit to you. How does one-to-one coaching in the beginning of each season sounds like?

If you want to do more than one course/class per week, then we absolutely recommend the Dance Pass!

### How to get dancing with the Dance Pass

1. **Buy a Dance Pass**  
  [Buy your Dance Pass here][1]  
  If you choose year-around or monthly pass you can start dancing right away! The pass is valid right after the purchase.  
  With season pass, pass is only valid for the season you bought it for.

2. **Secure your place in the course**  
  We recommend you register for the courses you intend to take regularly. Priority is given for all the Dance Pass holders during first 2 weeks of the registration.  
  Of course you can also just drop-in to any of the class.  
  Note: If you attend a partnered dance class without a partner, you must book a place in advance! That is unless you can do both roles. This is so that we can maintain the role balance.

3. **Arrive to class and show your pass to the teacher**  
  Please show your pass to teacher of the class upon arrival.  
  (We'll create the digital passes by the next season. Before that, please show your purchase receipt.)

**BONUS:** If your purchase included complimentary coaching session(s), book those for each season separately by sending us an email at {{ site.email }}.

* **Do I have to register for the courses separately?**
