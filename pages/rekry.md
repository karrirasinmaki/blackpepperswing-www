Black Pepper Swing was founded in 2017 and the very first courses started during that autumn simultaneously in Helsinki, Tampere, and Jyväskylä. It was a wild start for a new dance school founded by two very young but passionate swing dancers. Since then we have focused more on our current hometown (Helsinki), the scene here has grown bigger, and we have gained thousands of kilometers worth of experience.

The next chapter is building a strong team that can offer an exceptional service to our local dance community.

### Dance teacher

We are always looking for new dance teachers to join our crew!

We are especially looking for inspiring teachers who could teach multiple hours and possibly on multiple days and would enjoy being in front of the camera. You may either be really deeply focused on one dance style or have great knowledge of multiple styles. A big plus is if your presence/charisma will draw in new people into classes and you’d do active work promoting our courses and events. We can offer you weekly classes (any day mon-sun) and/or workshops to teach.

Also, all our regular dance teachers can attend any of our classes, and most of our events, free of charge!

We value skills and experience but also equally much passion, compassion, and good vibes. Unique personalities and styles are much appreciated too!

Interested? Send us an email with your dance and teaching history/background and we can start the conversation from there.
