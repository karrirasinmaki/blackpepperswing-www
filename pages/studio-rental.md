## Save your neighbours' nerves and come monkey around at our studio!

We have moved to the new location - Karjalankatu 2!

We have two separate ~100m² dance/practice studios, plus a kitchen and a hang-out space. Both studios are now open for practice!

---

Whether you are looking for a place to practice tapping, dancing, popping, locking, playing, singing, trumpeting, handstanding, or anything else, our studios give you the space and acoustics to do it.

We have two studio rooms with a bit different equipment from each other. A beautiful landscape over Helsinki opens up from both of the studios.

Both studios have a good old sprung wooden floor which is kind to your joints. The front room has a brand new floor and hence we ask all the tappers to use the back room for their practices. Otherwise you can dance in any kind of shoes - hard-soled shoes, high heels, and indoor rubber shoes - just make sure their soles are clean.

**The front room** is our social dance floor with a brand new dance parquet. There is a great PA system with active speakers as well as cozy sofa area waiting for you. This studio will have a nice living room vibe in it once we have hung some curtains, a few mirrors, and random stuff on a wall - as well as maxing out the coziness factor. The front room is also a pathway into the other parts of the studio, so some traffic may occur here.

**The back room** is more like a traditional dance room with a nice wide mirror wall and great PA system. Once we have fixed the acoustics to the top we can call it ready-ready. Here we have two sides full of windows which fill up the room with light. But if you choose so, you can close yourself in the darkness with the curtains. Curtains are high-quality Molton fabric so they’ll absorb both light and sounds. The back room offers a bit more privacy too since there will be no one trespassing.

## Address

There are 3 free parking slots in the yard of the building (2h with the parking disc). The rest of the slots are reserved for tenants. More parking slots can be found by the street.

The entrance is thru the main entrance from Karjalankatu. There should be Black Pepper Swing signs at the door. Look out for a glass door that says "Pääsisäänkäynti" or "A-, B-, C- portaat".

We'll give you the access details to the studio upon booking.
