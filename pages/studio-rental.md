## Save your neighbours' nerves and come monkey around at our studio!

We have moved to the new location - Karjalankatu 2!

We have two separate ~100m² dance/practice studios, plus a kitchen and a hang-out space. Both studios are now open for practice!

---

Whether you are looking for a place to practice tapping, dancing, popping, locking, playing, singing, trumpeting, handstanding, or anything else, our studios give you the space and acoustics to do it.

We have two studio rooms with a bit different equipment from each other. A beautiful landscape over Helsinki opens up from both of the studios.

Both studios have a good old sprung wooden floor which is kind to your joints. The front room has a brand new floor and hence we ask all the tappers to use the back room for their practices. Otherwise you can dance in any kind of shoes - hard-soled shoes, high heels, and indoor rubber shoes - just make sure their soles are clean.

**The front room** is our social dance floor with a brand new dance parquet. There is a great PA system with active speakers as well as cozy sofa area waiting for you. This studio will have a nice living room vibe in it once we have hung some curtains, a few mirrors, and random stuff on a wall - as well as maxing out the coziness factor. The front room is also a pathway into the other parts of the studio, so some traffic may occur here.

**The back room** is more like a traditional dance room with a nice wide mirror wall and great PA system. Once we have fixed the acoustics to the top we can call it ready-ready. Here we have two sides full of windows which fill up the room with light. But if you choose so, you can close yourself in the darkness with the curtains. Curtains are high-quality Molton fabric so they’ll absorb both light and sounds. The back room offers a bit more privacy too since there will be no one trespassing.

## General info


### Cleaning

Please leave the space in the same or better condition than it was before you.

General maintenance cleaning is done by us and is included in the rent (unless otherwise stated). So, we'll take care of mopping the floors, taking out trash and bottles, cleaning the toilet, etc.

Your task is to put things back in their places, clean up your trashes and spills, and to shut down PA-systems as well as close and lock the windows and doors before you leave.


### Windows and doors

You can open windows to increase the ventilation. Just remember to close and lock down all the windows and doors before you leave.


### Specs

The studio is around 260m² with two dance rooms both around 100². Other rooms are kitchen, toilet, dressing/hang-out room, storage/office, storage/electicity room, and cloakroom. The height of the rooms are around 2.7 meters with some columns, bars, and pipes occuping some of the space. Extra toilets and showers are located near the elevators on levels 4 and 3 and shared with our neighbours.
