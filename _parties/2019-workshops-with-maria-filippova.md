## Basic Lindy Solo\* Technique with Maria Filippova

_*Solo stands for exercises without a partner, not for Jazz roots._

Knowing how to dance on your own is the key to great partner dancing. That's why Maria Filippova will own this class to exercises without a partner! And it's meant for Lindy hoppers of all roles and genders.

Footwork variations and how to create them. 

We will first get work on our rhythmic foundation, finding the connection between swing music and our steps.

Then we’ll recreate the basic shapes/figures we dance in lindy hop and after we’ll add some nice variations which deriving from rhythm changes and influenced by some solo jazz moves.

At the end you’ll have a deeper understanding of the swing music structure and be able to generate new footwork variations by yourself and put them into the flow of the couple dance. And of course you’ll have left some certain variations as an examples from the class.

**Requirement:** You should have been taking Lindy hop classes for at least 1 year.

## Int-Adv. Lindy Solo\* Technique with Maria Filippova

_*Solo stands for exercises without a partner, not for Jazz roots._

Time to work on your Lindy hop... solo, without a partner! This class with super skilled Maria Filippova  for hoppers of all roles and genders at Intermediate-Advanced level will give you an insight into:

Body awareness. 

This lesson will touch a few different topics: balance (stay-ability), isolations, posture, groove, twists, turns, slides. We’ll go through all these little things we usually don’t have time to think of when it comes to a couple dancing. How to step, which part of the foot to use, how to move while standing on one foot, how to turn and not to fall, how to express different groove in the music. 

After the class you’ll be more aware about the choices you make during the dance. This awareness plus new skills and moves in your body will give you a level up. 

**Requirement:** You should have been taking Lindy hop classes and dancing "on fire" for at least 2 years.
