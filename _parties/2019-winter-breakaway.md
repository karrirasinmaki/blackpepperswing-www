On the weekend 9-10th of March it will be time again to give our swing dancing a little international booster. We invited four absolutely wonderful teachers to share their skills, knowledge and ideas with us:

- Carla St & Andrés Lázaro (Madrid, Spain)
- Eliisa Õunamägi & Janek Õunamägi (Tallinn, Estonia)

During the mini-workshop weekend you can pick from a palette of different theme classes with or without level requirements.

The classes will take place on Saturday and Sunday. Saturday night is of course reserved for an exhilarating dance party.

Locations and schedule will be announced soon.
