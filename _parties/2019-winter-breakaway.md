On the weekend 9-10th of March it will be time again to give our swing dancing a little international booster. We invited four absolutely wonderful teachers to share their skills, knowledge and ideas with us:

- Carla St & Andrés Lázaro (Madrid, Spain)
- Eliisa Õunamägi & Janek Õunamägi (Tallinn, Estonia)
- Maria Puustinen & Karri Rasinmäki (BPS) (Beginners course)

During the mini-workshop weekend you can pick from a palette of different theme classes with different level requirements.

The classes will take place on Saturday and Sunday. Saturday night is of course reserved for an exhilarating dance party at Balderin sali with live music.

**Registration**

Each class is pre-defined by a topic and is registered for separately (25e / 1h55min).
The only exception to this is the Beginner’s introduction course, for which registration is done for the entire weekend (50e / 4h). In the registration form you can sign up for classes and party.
Spots are limited to ~20 participants per workshop

**Locations**

Classes take place in Hautomo Dance school in Merimiehenkatu 29 except:
Shim Sham Tap Rhythm variations, Solo Jazz with Andres, and Sunday’s Intro to Lindy hop.
These will take place in Fiesta Flamenca, Laivurinrinne 5 (300m walking). 

Saturday party with live music at Balderin sali, Aleksanterinkatu 12.

**Levels**

All classes are rather defined by the topic than by a certain level, but you will have the best workshop experience if you fill these minimum requirements.

- Beginners: No previous dance experience needed
- Basic: 0,5 - 1,5 years of active dancing
- Intermediate to Advanced: More than 1,5 years of active dancing

**Additional notes**

- Open-ended lead & follow: Achieving a balanced dance conversation, less traditional lead/follow.
- Shim Sham Tap Rhythm variations: You can use your soft-soled shoes for this class, but bring tap shoes if you have some.
