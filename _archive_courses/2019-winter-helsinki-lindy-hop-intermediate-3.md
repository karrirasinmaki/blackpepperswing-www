### Content
Things are getting serious and seriously awesome! You have probably been dancing around 1 to 2 years “on fire” or maybe longer with less intensity. You can fluidly social dance but you still struggle to dance with people who are less or way more experienced than you. You also look for better access to interpret music and improvise while dancing. You might also be on the hunt for styling and easy flashy moves.

We rotate partners during lesson.

### Requirements
We expect you to be taken Intermediate classes worth of 2-3 courses or seasons (4-9 months). Ask the teachers if you are not sure which level/group would be most suitable for you. 😊

### Registration
You can sign up alone or with a partner. Participants are accepted in order of registration. After registration through the link you will receive a confirmation within a couple of days.
