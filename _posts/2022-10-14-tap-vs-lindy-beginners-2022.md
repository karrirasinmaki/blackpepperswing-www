### So you want to dance!

You have heard about swing dancing?  
Or appareantly thinking about starting a dance hobby?  
You are in a right place!

We have two new beginners courses starting very soon, Lindy Hop and Tap Dance.

**But what are those and which one is for you... Let's find out!**

## Tap or Lindy

You'll have fun with any beginners' course, really. But...

...if you want to learn how to partner dance, take [Lindy Hop](https://portal.blackpepperswing.com/courses?q=lindy%20hop%20beginners).

...if you like rhythms or love Gene Kelly, [Tap Dancing](https://portal.blackpepperswing.com/courses?q=tap%20beginners) would be your thing.

And of course, if you can't decide, you can take them both (second course comes with -25% discount).


Here are samples of Tap dance (first video), and Lindy Hop (second video).
