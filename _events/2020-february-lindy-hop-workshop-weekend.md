You can come on your own or with a friend. After the course, you'll have all the necessary tools to enter weekly swing dances in Helsinki.

## WORK YOUR CONNECTION
For improvers/intermediate and up

This class is all about the most essential concepts of open partner connection. We take a deeper look into the main principles we use to connect with our partner on a dance floor in open position. Through exercises, we expand our understanding of how certain type of connection might affect our dancing, and how we can use connection to communicate our ideas better. We will learn about handholds, stretch, compression, counter balance and other tools & tricks to connect better.
