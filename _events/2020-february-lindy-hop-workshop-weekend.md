During the total of 4h of lessons, you will get a profound insight into the world of authentic swing dancing. You will get a sense of interpreting swinging rhythm in dancing, how to both\* lead and follow the movement, and learn some of the moves lindy hoppers have been rocking since the 1920s.

You can come on your own or with a friend. After the course, you'll have all the necessary tools to enter weekly swing dances in Helsinki.

Price: 50€ per person, students and unemployed get 10% discount
