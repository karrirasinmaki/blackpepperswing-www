## 10 years of dancing
by Karri Rasinmäki / Black Pepper Swing


I have a story to share with you.

I have been dancing for 10 full years now. That’s a rather long time for a 30-year-old man. That’s ⅓ of my whole life. And almost all of my adulthood.

This is a story about my dance journey.

Exactly 10 years ago, as a freshman at Helsinki University, living my first year of “independent life”, I discovered swing dancing. I must say it was the perfect time for me to start dancing. New in the big city, discovering my ambitions, reforming my identity after the lukio and asepalvelus.

Now, that 10-year-long path has taken me through wonderful experiences, extremely driven training, and a whole bunch of life-altering ideas. Finally co-founding this dance school and flipping my career path into a completely new direction.

I want to share this story with you.

I want to share all I’ve learned and experienced so far.

I want to share all this understanding and knowledge I possess.

I want to share this with you.

### Experience the story

10 years is a long time. I have many stories to share with you from this journey. And the best way I can do it is to throw a series of workshops and masterclasses.

**I invite you to my 10 years of dancing workshops:**

- To learn and experience all key discoveries and concepts I have to share from my dancing journey
- To celebrate this milestone together and create a whole lot of new inspiration for the next 10 years
- To collaborate and share your enthusiasm to fire up these workshops with great energy


This milestone celebration consists of a series of workshops and masterclasses. I will share the findings of my dance journey in the form of these workshops and masterclasses throughout 2024.

Join these workshops and masterclasses to hear and experience all of this story!

First masterclasses in March 1-2 ➣ [Register here][booking]{:.button .small .round}

Each workshop will be a master class type of experience with deep knowledge for enthusiastic participants. My way of teaching relies heavily on experience-based learning. Seeking understanding over knowledge and a great amount of trial, error, and action.
