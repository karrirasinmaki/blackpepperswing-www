## Tacky Anna bringing again the tackiest party to all swing dancers.

We celebrate friendships on the weekend after Valentine's Day (Friend's Day). And if you want to get your friend hooked on this world too, we have a Lindy Hop Beginners's weekend conveniently taking place on the same weekend.

By the way, did you know why it's literally "Friend's Day" in Finnish? Well, here's why:

In Finnish, Valentine’s Day is called ystävänpäivä (literally “Friend’s Day”)

In Finland, friendship is what’s celebrated on Valentine’s Day. People give gifts and cards to their best friends; it’s not just for romantic partners.
