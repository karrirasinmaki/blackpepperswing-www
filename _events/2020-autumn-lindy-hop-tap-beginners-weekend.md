During the weekend Aug 22-23, we bring you a workshop for total beginners in Lindy hop and Tap dance. The workshop weekend is held at our dance hall in Bulevardi 31. Registration will open July 17 at 4PM.

## LINDY HOP

During the total of 4h of lessons, you will get a profound insight into the world of authentic swing dancing. You will get a sense of interpreting swinging rhythm in dancing, how to both lead and follow simple movement, and learn some of the iconic moves lindy hoppers have been rocking since the 1920s.

No previous dance experience needed. All you need is a partner. When choosing a partner for dancing, the most important is that the two of you are ready to work together as a team. In our Beginners’ course everybody learns the basics of leading and following regardless of gender. If you don’t have a partner, you can use our BPS Community Facebook group to ask around for one.

After the weekend course, we will offer a follow-up course on a time agreed with the group.

## More about the dances:

### Lindy hop

Lindy hop is an energetic and rhythmical dance which emerged in the African-American communities in Harlem, New York, during the late 1920’s. It became a dance craze with the popularisation of jazz music by artists like Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Benny Goodman and countless others. In Lindy hop both partners are invited to improvise within the flow of the dance and to have an equal voice. Lindy hop experienced a huge revival in the 1990’s and has since then spread all over the planet.

### Tap dancing

Tap dancing was more or less a must for any dancer during the era of American show business of the golden age of pre-jazz and jazz. A percussive dance based on rhythm, timing and balance, where the executor is also a front line musician. Tap dancing became famous through Hollywood movies with dancers like Betty Grable, Ruby Keeler, Eleanor Powell, Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly and Bill Robinson and it is still often brought back to the silver screen in modern movies like La La Land.
