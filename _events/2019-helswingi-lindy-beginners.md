Are you a Lindy hop Newbie? This track is for everyone who has maybe never danced before or is not yet comfortable with the basics. You don’t need any previous experience nor a partner. The very experienced teacher Adrian Ehrlich will take you through the fundamentals of the dance in four hours of classes.

Helswingi’s Sunday party is included in the price of the Beginners’ track, so you get to apply everything you learned during the weekend on the social dance floor - and meet the community.

Saturday: 12.00 - 14.00  
Sunday: 13.00 - 15.00

_Workshop includes also Helswingi Sunday party and Sunday taster._
