_3rd party organizer. Event organized by Tuesday Night Hop & Minna Marttila._

Tuesday Night Hop is a weekly event in Helsinki dedicated to swing music.

Djs play danceable swing music including the classic songs by Count Basie, Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong. Spicing it up with some gypsy swing, rhythm'n'blues and new orleans jazz. And not forgetting the modern crowd favorites like Candy Jacket Jazz Band, Hot Sugar Band and Glenn Crytzer.

All music lovers, beginner dancers, non dancers and swing dance veterans are welcomed to enjoy Tuesday Nigth Hop.

_Free entrance (except during the [Live nights](#live-nights))_
