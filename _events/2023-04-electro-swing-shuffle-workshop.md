Join us on April 22-23, 2023, at Black Pepper Swing, for a weekend of high-energy dancing and learning. We'll have a set of beginners and open-level classes on Electro Swing and Shuffle.

You will have the opportunity to dance alongside Magdalena in the video and create a memory of your experience.

Magdalena is a dance craftsman, who believes in hard work and training to become a dancer. Her love for dancing is contagious, and she will inspire and motivate dancers of all levels.

### About Magdalena

Professional dancer and dance teacher with a 15-year experience on scene and in the training room. She calls herself more a craftsman than an artist as she believes that being a good dancer is not about being born one but about love for dancing and determination for hard work and training to become a dancer.

Em since she was a child has been performing other dance styles as well. Those can be easily identified in her live performances. She likes combining styles she loves and that’s why you can often see her performing classic rotations, Charleston twists and even cutting shapes elements.

She’s a founder of the first Polish dance school focusing on Electro Swing and Shuffle. As a teacher she teaches all levels of experience, from beginners to real experts. Her mission is to share her love for dancing with as many as possible.
