Lindy in the Park celebrates its fifteenth summer. This summer we dance in the park every Tuesday from 28th May 'till 13th August.

Our djs play danceable swing music including the classic songs by Count Basie, Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong. Spicing it up with some gypsy swing, rhythm'n'blues and new orleans jazz. And not forgetting the modern crowd favorites like Candy Jacket Jazz Band, Hot Sugar Band and Glenn Crytzer.

Occasionally with a live band! More info on the event's Facebook page.

Everybody's welcome to enjoy the sun, swinging music, dance and nice company!

_Free entrance_  

### What is Lindy hop?

Lindy hop is a fun and expressive dance born in Harlem in the late 1920's danced to swinging jazz music. Here is some example of Lindy hop: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfFNEL3uAUk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfFNEL3uAUk) or here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3kvAt_TmPg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3kvAt_TmPg).
