The Winter Breakaway is back!

For the second time we are organizing workshops in our mid-season series: the Winter Breakaway. On the 6th - 8th of March you get to focus on your non-partnered dancing with Solo Jazz in two levels and Tap dancing. On Saturday 7th we will also throw a dance party with space for whatever swings outs the heart of a Lindy hopper.

Besides lovely local teachers, we also invited the experienced, fun, warm-hearted and “on point” instructor Cat Foley from the UK to help you take your first, second or maybe one-millionth jazz step.

No previous dance experience required, but some swing dance experience is recommended.

**Where to continue after the workshop?**
