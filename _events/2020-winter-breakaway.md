The Winter Breakaway is back!

For the second time we are organizing workshops in our mid-season series: the Winter Breakaway. On the 7th -8th of March you get to focus on your non-partnered dancing with Solo Jazz in two levels, Tap dancing and bunch of Lindy hop classes. On Saturday 7th we will also throw a dance party with space for whatever swings outs the heart of a Lindy hopper.

Besides lovely local teachers, we also invited the experienced, fun, warm-hearted and "on point" instructor Cat Foley from the UK to help you take your first, second or maybe one-millionth jazz step.

More details about the instructors, locations, schedules and registration will be published during the next days, so stay tuned like a guitar !
