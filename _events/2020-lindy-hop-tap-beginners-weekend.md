New year, new skills!

Come and join our beginners' weekend course to get your Lindy hop or Tap dance started, or maybe to strengthen your base! 


## LINDY HOP

During the total of 4h of lessons you will get a profound insight into the world of authentic swing dancing. You will get a sense of interpreting swinging rhythm in dancing, how to both\* lead and follow movement, and learn some of the moves lindy hoppers have been rocking since the 1920’s.

No previous experience whatsoever needed! You can come on your own or with a friend. After the course you'll have all the necessary tools to enter weekly swing dances in Helsinki.

Course costs 50€ per person, students and unemployed get 10% off.
