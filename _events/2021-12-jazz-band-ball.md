We are throwing a dance ball to honor the gods of jazz and swingouts at one of Helsinki's oldest ballrooms, Kirjantalon juhlasali. The band Downtown Dixie Tigers, founded in 1958, will keep your feet stomping with their bouncy arrangements of classics from Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and many others.

Join in for an evening of happy and hot jazz and practise your rusty post-pandemic social (dance) skills.

- 17.30-18.30 Open level class with Kay & Tanja "Tastes like Charleston"  
- 18.30-19.00 DJ music  
- 19.00-22.00 DDT Jazz band  
- 22.00-23.00 DJ music  

The ticket sale will open on the 28th of October at 4PM.
