Did you get ill-fitting clothes for Christmas presents? Is your wardrobe full of stuff you don’t use anymore? Would you like new clothes but don’t want to destroy the planet by buying new?

The answer to everything is Black Pepper Swing Clothes Exchange Brunch! Bring clothes you want to get rid of, and browse through clothes other people have brought. Or just do one or the other!

The idea is to give and take clothes for free, but there will also be a separate corner for clothes/shoes you would like to sell for money. 

There will be coffee and tea available, and something small to eat. Bring more brunch food if you will, and let’s have a Sunday brunch! And since it is a dance studio, lazy swing music will be available to dance to among other activities!

Free entrance.

PS. You can leave your un-exchanged clothes at the studio and we will put them forward in appropriate charity or recycle.
